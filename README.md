# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Melatonin Product Reviews

This project is focused on analyzing consumer sentiments for melatonin products listed on Amazon. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and visualization tools, we aim to uncover insights into user preferences, product attributes, and overall sentiment trends to aid better product understanding and marketing strategies.

## **Project Objective**
The goal of this project is to:
- **Understand Consumer Sentiments:** Analyze the textual reviews to gauge customer opinions.
- **Identify Patterns:** Extract meaningful insights regarding product attributes such as flavor, dosage, and form (e.g., gummy or tablet).
- **Explore Usage Preferences:** Examine how timing, duration, and usage phrases affect user experiences and sentiments.
- **Visualize Key Findings:** Provide interactive and static visualizations to convey the insights effectively.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Sentiment Analysis**
- Performed polarity-based sentiment scoring to classify reviews into positive, neutral, or negative categories.
- Identified trends in consumer satisfaction based on key product attributes such as flavor and dosage.

### **2. NLP and Data Cleaning**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the textual reviews using techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- Extracted key phrases such as "usage timing" and "duration of use" to gain deeper insights into consumer behavior.

### **3. Visualizations**
- **Average Sentiment by Flavor:**
  - A horizontal bar chart to highlight which flavors receive the highest and lowest sentiments.
  - Interactive Plotly visualization with a color scale to differentiate sentiment intensity.
- **Average Sentiment by Usage Phrases:**
  - A bar chart showcasing how user-described usage scenarios (e.g., "30 minutes before bed") correlate with sentiment scores.

### **4. Business Insights**
- Insights on user preferences for flavors, dosage forms, and timing for taking melatonin.
- Patterns in long-term vs. short-term product usage and their corresponding sentiments.
- Recommendations for product improvement and marketing strategies.
